      this is based on BookDetailView, which exposes a single Book object as the `book`.
      from there, we can then take the fields of the model as shown below

      from mdn:
      That's it! All you need to do now is create a template called /locallibrary/catalog/templates/catalog/book_detail.html, 
      and the view will pass it the database information for the specific Book record extracted by the URL mapper. 
      Within the template you can access the list of books with the template variable named object OR book 
      (i.e. generically "the_model_name").
